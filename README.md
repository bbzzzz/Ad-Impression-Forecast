# Ad-Impression-Forecast

This is a project I did for online in-image ad vendor GumGum. GumGum aims to forecast ad impression numbers on GumGumâ€™s affiliated websites in the next 30 days based on the past 365 days data.

The final forecast model is an ensemble of five simple models:

- Seasonal naive model
- Linear regression model with trend and seasonal dummy variables (day of week)
- SVM regression with trend and seasonal dummy variables (day of week)
- STL + ETS/Arima model
- Arima model
