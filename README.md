# Ad-Impression-Forecast

This is a project I did for in-image ad vendor GumGum.

Below is a brief discription of the project:

GumGum serves ads on affiliated websites (owned by our publishers). We refer to these shown ads as ad impressions . We would like to predict future ad impressions based on past statistics. You are given a list of ad impression numbers from the past 365 days as a training set and a list of ad impression numbers from the next 30 days as a validation set. Your goal is to come up with a model that takes a vector of 365 ad impression numbers as input and predicts and returns a vector of the ad impressions in the next 30 days.

Here's the link to my code and visulization. The R code can be found above.
